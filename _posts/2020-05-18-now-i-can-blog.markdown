After my master's degree, I need a place to brag about my thesis. So I just assembled a default [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) setup with [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you want to do [the same](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) you probably have to modify your ``baseurl`` variable in the ``_config.yml`` as well. 
Otherwise, GitHub won't resolve the paths correctly. A simple problem, but with limited experience in web technology, it can take some time to wrap your head around what's going on ^^

Well, who would have thought I would include some actual information in a test post? I hope I didn't educate someone by accident :grimacing: (Emojis brought to you by [jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji)).
